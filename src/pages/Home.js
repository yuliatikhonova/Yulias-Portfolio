                    In the About Me tab is a short description of my lifeâ€™s journey to this point. It includes my journey moving country to country, and my academic and job path.

                    In the Portfolio page is a list of homework and projects that were completed during the bootcamp. I had a total of three projects that I had to collaborate with a team to get the work done. Most of the items in my portfolio I was able to deploy. If the item does not have a deployed link, it's because it was done only in node.
